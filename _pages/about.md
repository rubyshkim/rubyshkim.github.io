I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan. I received my PhD in Mathematics from Duke University in May 2022. My research interests are in mathematical biology studied using methods from dynamical systems and scientific computing.

I have seven years of experience teaching college mathematics including calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and mathematical modeling. I also have a [Certificate in College Teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching/) from Duke University.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
