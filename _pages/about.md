I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan. I received my PhD in Mathematics from Duke University in May 2022. My research interests are in mathematical biology studied using methods from dynamical systems and scientific computing.

I have seven years of experience teaching college mathematics including calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and mathematical modeling. I also have a [Certificate in College Teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching/) from Duke University.
