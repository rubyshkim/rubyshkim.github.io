##### Dynamics of Circadian Rhythms

The circadian timekeeping system operates across multiple spatial and temporal scales, from molecular clocks in individual cells to networks of neurons that synchronize through fast synaptic and slower paracrine signaling. Together, these coupled dynamical systems form a robust and flexible framework influenced by environmental cues like light and meal timing.

##### Mathematical Models from Wrist-Wearable Device Data

I am interested in translating wearable device data into digital biomarkers. For example, we can use mathematical models to study various circadian rhythms (in activity, heart rate, and sleep) and the misalignment between them. We have found that circadian misalignment is linked with mood, seasonal behavior, and shift work adaptation.

##### Mathematical Modeling for Women's Health

Women have historically been underrepresented in medical studies, contributing to health disparities. See this 2024 article on ["Why we know so little about women’s health."](https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health) Mathematical models allow for a stronger understanding of human health problems and can be used to advance personalized healthcare approaches.
